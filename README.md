## Overview
Expansion is a central aim for all organizations. However, several things are worth considering for an organization to reap the maximum benefit of expansion. Otherwise, it may end up loosing in a field others are doing good in. 
Microsoft entering the movie production industry is a positive move in its expansion in the technology industry. However, it must be informed enough to reap the benefits of the expansion. Thus, it is crucial that it looks into the movie production market and identify the most selling movies and the best studio to put up. Also, it must look into the profitability of the business domestically and globally for maximum benefits. 

## Business Understanding
The project aims at providing directives on the possible lookout factors before entering the movie production industry. The provision of a path on the vital element is imminent, from which deductions are made based on the evaluation of the factors. It answers some of the future questions regarding this entry on what type of movies the company should produce based on customer consumption. Also, the project evaluates the sales in markets for a transparent target market, either domestic or foreign, based on the movies' gross sales in both markets. Considering that profit making is a sole purpose in this organization, just like any other, a cost-benefit analysis concerning the production budget, foreign an worlwide gross sales conflict to give way forward on whether the firm should enter the market.

This project finds out whether Microsoft should enter the movie production industry or not. If yes, what is the relationship between some lookout factors, and which top movies should venture into the initial production to break even and compete with other companies in the industry?

#### Recommendation 1
Microsoft should enter the movie production industry to boost its profits. However, it should look for a market for its products away from its country since the gain in domestic sales is insufficient and may sometimes drive the organization into losses. Thus, expansion to the global mindset is key to entering the movie production sector. 
#### Recommendation 2
Among the many studios, it should invest in, the BV studio is the most sufficient to boost the companyâ€™s profit. Despite the unpromising nature of the domestic market, as realized above, this studio gives the highest payoffs at the domestic level. Such high domestic incomes would alternatively promise more at the worldwide level where the movies are selling highly. 
#### Recommendation 3
Again, there are movies that Microsoft must prioritize to achieve highly desired sales. These movies are the top movies, especially in terms of popularity. They are; Blade Runner 2049, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War, John Wick, and Big Hero 6. 
#### Recommendation 4

There is the need to overlook the voting concept since it is just slightly correlated with popularity.
